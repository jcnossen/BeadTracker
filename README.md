BeadTracker
===========

Complete magnetic tweezers setup code as used in the Nynke Dekker Lab, TUDelft, Netherlands (http://nynkedekkerlab.tudelft.nl/).
Using qtrk for image processing (see submodule), so hundreds of beads can be tracked simultaneously.

This code is used on several setups within our lab. It does need some work to get running on each specific hardware configuration.
(different motors, camera's, etc).

Disclaimer: Labview is used for historical reasons. 
I tried my best to make a decent design, but spaghetti wires and chaos still ensued.
Labview should not be used for anything that requires more than 2 days of work.
